after burning the disc, pull up a web page; click "new disc."
Fill in track info: artist/show, date, burn date...
click 'save'
get disc ID back
write on disc

---

in iTunes:

insert disc
select dropdown: fill in track names
prompt for disc ID
populate fields

the latter can be done by the main scripts dropdown

create/read/update/delete? hmm
show database controller?

make a show database/controller... if we go all out, we use all fields in itunes. could be overkill though.

objects: discs. is there anything else?

a disc and one or more tracks... this object model is already
mapped out, silly
